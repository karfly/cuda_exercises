sine_calc - calculate linear series of sine on GPU

Purpose: learn the basics of CUDA C programming

Fill the parts of the code marked with "TODO"s to get a fully working sample.
For CUDA API calls, please refer to the CUDA Reference Manual in doc/.

Correct version of the sample should work like:

$ make
nvcc -g -O3 -DBLOCK_SIZE=512 sine_calc.cu -o sine_calc

$ ./sine_calc 
Usage: ./sine_calc <n>
Where n must be a multiplier of 512

$ ./sine_calc 1024
n = 1024
Max diff = 0.000012% @ i = 23: 0.534998 != 0.534998
